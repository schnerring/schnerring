# üëã Greetings from Switzerland

When I was a first grader in the mid-90s, I got my first Windows 95 computer as a gift from my dad. Since then, I have been fascinated by computers and the Internet, giving me access to an ever-expanding universe. I‚Äôve lived throughout the digital age since its dawn and I continue to be amazed at how technology is shaping our world ever faster, for better and for worse.

With infinite amounts of information at my fingertips, I love discovering and learning new things every day. I enjoy building (and breaking) tech to efficiently solve real-world problems. When I‚Äôm on my own time, I sometimes like over-engineering things just because I can. üöÄ

However, few soulless corporations control the Web. I actively sponsor and contribute to open-source projects to make the WWW a more human and independent place again. I strive to regain as much of my digital privacy as possible and educate others by documenting my journey. But it‚Äôs tough ‚Äî a constant balancing act between convenience and nuisance, between being an advisor and being a preacher, between being a cypherpunk and being a hypocrite.

On [my website](https://schnerring.net), I share my thoughts and notes about things that I‚Äôm excited about and working on, and hope to connect with people having a similar mindset. I‚Äôd love to hear from you!
