# 👋 Greetings

When I was a first grader in the mid-90s, I got my first Windows 95 computer as a gift from my dad. Since then, I have been fascinated by computers and the Internet, giving me access to an ever-expanding universe. I’ve lived throughout the digital age since its dawn and I continue to be amazed at how technology is shaping our world ever faster, for better and for worse.

I love discovering and learning new things every day. I enjoy building (and breaking) tech to efficiently solve real-world problems. When I’m on my own time, I sometimes like over-engineering things just because I can. 🚀

On [my website](https://schnerring.net), I share my thoughts and notes about things that I’m excited about and working on, and hope to connect with people having a similar mindset. I’d love to hear from you!
